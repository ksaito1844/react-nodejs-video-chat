# üí¨ Video Chat App

A video chat app created with Socket.io, Typescript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
  

## ‚ú®Overview

### Purpose

*Why did I build this project?*

- To learn and develop my skills in Test Driven Development.
- To learn about web sockets and learn how to use [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).
- To learn about [RTCPeerConnection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/RTCPeerConnection).

### Process

*What was your process for completing this project?* 

I used a kanban board for creating user stories and keeping track of bugs. 

### Challenges

#### RTC Peer Connection
Setting up the peer-to-peer connection for the two-way video streaming was a difficult task. I used the project [WebRTC Video and Signaling sample](https://github.com/mdn/samples-server/tree/master/s/webrtc-from-chat) as a starting point and main reference. I was able to understand the process better when I added dev logging to learn the order of the RTCPeerConnection events. Problems with the RTCPeerConnection emerged due to component re-rendering caused by state changes or changes in dependencies in callback functions. To resolve those problems, I removed state variables inside the component and used the React.memo function to ensure that no re-renders are performed.

### Outcome

*What did you learn from making this project?*

- I learned more about web sockets, WebRTC, and RTCPeer Connection.
- I learned how to use React.memo and React.useCallback.

### Retrospection

*What would you do differently next time?*

- Implement better file structure and organization at the beginning of the project instead of fixing it later.
- Install ESLint and set rules at the beginning of the project instead of adding it later.
- Write better tests.

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Clone this repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/timamero/react-nodejs-video-chat.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Add .env file and set value for `MONGODB_URI`
4. Run the server and client in development mode
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
 - Concurrently is used to run the server and client at the same time
 - You can also run the the app by running the server and client separately.
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
    *Open new terminal*
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

4. Open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000/.

5. To demo the video chat room go to http://localhost:3000/testroom.

## üß™ Testing
1. To run E2E testing run the following commands from the root folder.
    ```sh
    npm run cypress:prestart
    npm run cypress-e2e
    ```
2. To run component testing run the following commands from the root folder.
    ```sh
    npm run cypress:prestart
    npm run cypress-ct
    ```

E2E tests are located in `frontend/cypress/integration`.
Component tests are located in `frontend/src/__tests__`.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Extending the project
List of things I would like to do if I had more time:
- Add user authenitication with password
- Add tab component in home page so you can  switch between viewing active users, inactive users, and logged out users
- Enforce unique username
- Add tests for react components and redux slices
- Update and add tests for socket and database methods
- Add chat room for 3+ users (text chat only)
- In text chat, allow sending other media (images, gifs, audio)
